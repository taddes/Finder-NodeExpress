#Find Your Favorite Tea
Most people have misconceptions about a beverage they probably drink multiple times a week: tea! Most people think of tea as a small bag they leave in boiling water for minutes at a time and don't think beyond that.  In reality, tea comes in numerous forms and based on how it is handled after harvesting and tastes very differently, depending on what country it is from, what region it is grown in and what steps are taken to process it afterward.  Furthermore, things like 'chamomile tea' and 'mint tea' are not actually tea at all, but are herbal infusions. Tea is only tea if it's made from the Camellia Sinensis plant. For a brief breakdown of tea types and misconceptions, see this video I made breaking it all down:

This application will help you decide what kind of tea you might like most, based on your individual tastes.
