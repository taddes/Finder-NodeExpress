Most people have misconceptions about a beverage they probably drink multiple times a week: tea! Most people think of tea as a small bag they leave in boiling water for minutes at a time and don't think beyond that.  In reality, tea comes in numerous forms, depending on what country it is from, what region it is grown in and what steps are taken to process it afterward.  The steeping temperature and time are also very important to get the best flavor from your tea.  Most people get a bad idea of what tea should taste like, because it's brewed too long or at too high a temperature!  Furthermore, things like 'chamomile tea' and 'mint tea' are not actually tea at all, but are herbal infusions. Tea is only tea if it's made from the Camellia Sinensis plant. For a brief breakdown of tea types and misconceptions, see this video I made breaking it all down:

This application will help you decide what kind of tea you might like most, based on your individual tastes.  With so many options and varieties, it can often be hard to pick what kind of tea to make or buy.  Along with each pairing will be a link to purchase the tea from a reputable retailer along with some brewing instructions, so that you can make the best possible cup of that tea!
